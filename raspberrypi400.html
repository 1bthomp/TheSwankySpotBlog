      <br />
<div id="article">
    <p>Raspberry Pi has created some very well known products, and they have now added the Raspberry Pi 400 to their arsenal. The raspberry pi 400 is a whole computer inside a keyboard!! 
    </p>
    <br />
      <p>
        Let’s nerd out on this shall we? Out the box it comes with a mouse and of course the keyboard. The features that are included on the keyboard include: 4 GB of RAM, microSD slot, micro HDMI, micro DMI to HDMI cable, Ethernet port, 1 USB 2.0 slot, and 2 USB 3.0 slots. The CPU boasts a 4 core ARM® Cortex®-A72. The dimensions of the keyboard are 11.26" x 4.80" x 0.90" (286mm x 122mm x 23mm), which is a little bigger than the average size of a regular key board. The Pi 400 will also support up to 4K resolution on a dual monitor setup! You will also get an official copy of “The official Raspberry Pi Programmers Guide.” The Pi 400 also supports wi-fi and Bluetooth connectivity. The computer also is in the color red as well as the mouse. For $100, you can pick one of these bad boys up.

        Let’s talk performance. For this category we have to keep in mind the Raspberry Pi 400 is the first of its kind. Now if you’re expecting this to replace your gaming setup, then my friend you might have to wait a little longer. This is the beginning of a revolution so I’m sure as time goes on, there will be more improvements. You can do just about anything with this computer. You can surf the web, watch videos, play music, etc. It is a little on the slow side, but you can still get what you need to get done. The user interface will remind users of Apple, as it looks fairly similar to it. The mouse is used by connecting it to the keyboard. The mouse itself isn’t anything to write home about,  so again it gets the job done but not too many bells and whistles.
