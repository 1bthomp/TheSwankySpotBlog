    <h1 class="h1-article">Can the Lakers get it together? </h1>
      <br />
<div id="article">
    <p>Unless you live under a rock you know that the Lakers have been in deep waters throughout this season. It’s crazy to think that with a superstar roster that includes Lebron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook, all on one team, lost the game to the Denver Nuggets. </p>
    <br />
      <p>
        What’s more shocking is that Lebron and the Los Angeles Lakers have been ELIMINATED from the NBA playoffs. The team finished the season with 18 games under .500. As a fan it’s hurting to even type this, but it is what it is. Has Lebron lost his touch? Throughout his NBA career you can count on one hand how many times his missed the playoffs. Perhaps he has if with this much star power that happens. To give the Lakers some credit, with all this acquired talent they haven’t had a lot of time to get acquainted with each other’s skill set. Each starter on the team has been a superstar on their previous team before they came to the Sunny State of LA. So, maybe they needed this season to gel and so they can be a destructive beast monster of a team for next year. At least I hope that’s the case. The Lake Show is no longer what it used to be and it seems like Lebron has buyers remorse when he bought into the Lakers.
      </p> 
      <br />
      <p>Immediately following this news, there have been talks of Lebron wanting to team up with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors. Hearing those three names in the same sentence and seeing them on the same team would be a sight to see. Can you imagine that? It shouldn’t come to a shock. James is a seasoned player who knows how to win, and knows what it takes to get to the finals. So maybe this is the best move for him. Will Golden State have enough cap space to pay Lebron? Are Curry and his squad willing to take a pay cut for a ring? I guess we’ll see. </p>
