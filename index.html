                  <h2>Brian Thompson</h2>
                  <p>Tech, Cars, and Sports are my passion</p>
                </div>
                <p>Growing up I have always had an interest in these three avenues that I started to enjoy as a young kid, and still do to this day. My first introduction to technology  started off with playing my very first game of Super Mario Kart and Mortal Kombat on a nintendo 64. I am still a avid gamer and currently play on playstation 4 (my gamertag is btxpress72 if you'd like to add me). With hardware I started doing personal projects to my macbook pro, mac mini, hp, and dell computers such as upgrading my RAM and hard drives. Currently I am a software engenieer. I wanted to create this blog for those that have an interest in tech, cars, and sports like I do.</p> <p>Tech is changing just about everyday it seems like and sometimes it can be hard to keep up, but it shouldn't have to be. With The Swanky Spot you can stay up to date on the latest and greates technology that includes hardware, software, and applications and occasionally take a trip down memorly lane with some nostalgic throwbacks. You will also find out about video games here as well.</p>  
                
                <p>Any and all types of cars bring a smile to my face. However there is something special about V8's, small blocks and big blocks! I also like working on them, driving, racing, or going to car meets and shows. Here on The Swanky Spot you will find everything from pictures from car meets I attend, information on the latest vehicles, and also a look into classic cars.  </p> 

                <p>The main two sports that I have a great passion for are football and basketball. Although I do have my favorite players and teams (Panthers and Lakers) I won't be talking about any players personal life off the field, but I will be covering these two sports as the seasons progress.  </p>
