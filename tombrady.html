    <p>He has nothing left to prove, but to prove to himself he can win the Super Bowl one last time. Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers one the Super Bowl in 2021, making Tom Brady the player with the most super bowl rings, making for a total of 7. In a lot of peoples eyes, he’s the GOAT. At his long tenure in New England, he lead that team to 6 Super Bowls. TB12 still isn’t satisfied, as it is confirmed he is coming back to play in the NFL. Not with Tampa Bay, but The Miami Dolphins of all places. </p>
    <br />
      <p>
        Tom did say he wanted to play in Florida for his last few years of his career. But, it does seem strange that he would want to play with the Dolphins. Brady usually likes to go to teams that are well established, and good to go. Let’s just say, the dolphins have put in the work and have had a winning season, but if he does go there I’m sure he will experience a gap in talent. Could Tom have wanted to go to the Dolphins because of his buddy Gronk? It’s no secret Tom and Rob Gronkowski are two peas in a pod. Gronk was Toms go to receiver. So much so he left New England just to play with Tom again. The prestigious tight end has taken a lot of hits and made a lot of touchdowns in his career and has contemplated on coming back to play in the league on more than one occasion.
      </p> 
      <br />
      <p>None the less, we all know Tom Brady is going to ball out regardless of where he goes. His energy, aurora, experience, and shear will to win will take any team he’s on at least to the playoffs. But we all know he wants #8.  </p>
