      <br />
<div id="article">
    <p>Watching the Baltimore Ravens these past few years will have you contemplating who your favorite football team is. They’ve been that good. Let’s face it, if Lamar Jackson keeps up this pace that he’s on, he is going to go in the NFL Hall of Fame. With his freak of nature abilities on the grid iron, Jackson plays the humble card. His rookie contract is about to be over, and now he wants his money, and rightfully so.  </p>
    <br />
      <p>
        Jackson has a 98.1 QB rating that definitely has been earned. He gives his best effort on every play, every down. Since he’s been in the NFL, he has a total of 852 completions, 9967 yards passing, and 3673 yards rushing. For a rookie he’s earned big truss in his fans. Seeing what other top QBs are getting paid around the league, Lamar is playing the waiting game to get what he knows he truly deserves to be compensated for. 
      </p> 
      <br />
      <p>Jackson and the ravens seem to have great chemistry, and the squad they have are all straight dogs. I think if he stays, gets his paper, and stays healthy, I don’t see why they don’t make it deep into the playoffs. Let’s hope he gets his money AND a franchise tag.</p>
